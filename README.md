Ice and Fire Realty App
Description: The Ice and Fire Realty App was created as a group collaboration for a Software Development course. This project functions as a themed administrative application for realtors. It allows an admin to create Regions, Kingdoms, and Estate listings to aid in selling homes. The application borrows aspects of the A Song of Ice and Fire world (Game of Thrones) as inspiration.
